### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Siya Adrekar, a passionate computer science student at California State University Monterey Bay, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science.

As a multifaceted student, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science principles, algorithms, and data structures. My technical skills span a wide range of programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. I am proficient in using various tools and libraries such as Android Studio, IntelliJ, Anaconda, Jupyter, Google Colab, and Tableau, as well as machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

Throughout my academic and personal projects, I have gained hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning model development, and software engineering. Some of my notable projects include a movie genre prediction model, a library management system, a vending machine and banking system, and data analysis on car crash and dog shelter data.

I am driven by a genuine interest in leveraging technology, particularly in the field of healthcare, to drive positive change and improve people's lives. I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to real-world problems and contributing to innovative solutions that can transform the healthcare industry.
